# godot_intro
This is just a simple game built in the Godot 4+ engine to teach myself Godot.

It's based on the [FreeCodeCamp course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8lMTwSRoRg&t=982s) by [Omar Zaki](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_DV_XlyV-JXmAjUjg68ROg), but my code is in C# instead of GDScript and also heavily refactored in places.

Thanks to the legendary [Ansimuz](https://ansimuz.itch.io/) for the [free assets](https://ansimuz.itch.io/sunny-land-pixel-game-art) used in this project. üòÅ
